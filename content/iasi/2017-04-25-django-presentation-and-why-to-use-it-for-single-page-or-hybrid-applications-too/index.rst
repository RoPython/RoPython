        Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean,
        pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of
        Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

        * What is Django

      - Why to use Django for single page or hybrid applications too (Dan Tudorache)

        With the advent of new amazing front-end frameworks and the ever-increasing
        power of browsers and mobile processors, webapp users expect a dynamic, seamless
        user experience where page refresh is out of the question.
        Therefore server template rendering is not cool anymore. What to do?
        Use Django as a pure back-end. In this talk, technologies, strategies and
        third-party packages will be discussed, we will analyze and debate
        the advantages and disadvantages of Django opposed to other technologies.

      - Closing

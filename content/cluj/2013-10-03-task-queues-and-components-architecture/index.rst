I invite you to the 2nd Cluj Pythonistas meetup where two of the best
Python developers I know will tell you about subjects that they love:

- Celery introduction - Ionel Cristian Mărieș
- Zope Component Architecture - Sever Băneșiu

The event's host is Cluj Cowork and the recommended contribution for
that is 10 lei. See you there ...

P.S. Ring at "Ruby tribe" when you arrive.

      - **Numerical computing in Python** (Mihai Andrei)

        Numerical computing is the processing of large amounts of floating
        point data. It is the foundation for analyzing measurements and of scientific
        computing.

        Once arcane subjects of scientific computing are entering the
        mainstream. Machine learning and big data analytics are popular examples.

        Python is widely used in this domain, threatening established tools
        like matlab.

        Python's scientific ecosystem is based on a common data type: the
        mighty numpy array.

        We will introduce you to the numpy library, and along the way show off
        some other common used tools for numerical data.

      - **Python Balkan** (Bojan Jovanovic)

        A draft of the protocol of communication for python communities in
        Balkan. Bojan (Python Developer and founder of Kortechs) from Belgrade
        has a reputation for creating interesting python meetups in Belgrade.
        This time he would like to scale this up a bit by giving every
        community in the Balkan region the tools needed to upgrade their game
        a bit by giving the community organizers a way of acquiring quality
        content trough sharing.

Just a gathering over beers and/or other tasty stuff to talk about
Python and anything interesting, like what's going to happen at the
EuroPython2017 conference!

We'll also have one guest from Iași: Claudiu Popa. Does he still
maintain Pylint? Lets find out :D

Feel free to suggest location, if you have preferences.< p>

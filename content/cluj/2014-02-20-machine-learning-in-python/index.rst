Hello Pythonistas!

After a long break we'll meet again! This time the topic is machine
learning, one of Python's favorite use cases. Radu Marius Florin and
Roland Szabo will tell us more about it. After the meetup we'll go for a
drinkup to get to know each other better ...

The event will be hosted by Cluj Hub, where freelancers usually meet.

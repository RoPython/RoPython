For the next meetup we're going to do something different - an all-English show.

Hint: these presentations will be shown at EuroPython 2015 (don't tell anyone, it's a secret!)

      - Vlad Temian - gitfs: building a filesystem in Python

        gitfs is an open-source[1] filesystem which was designed
        to bring the full powers of Git to everyone, no matter how
        little they know about versioning. A user can mount any
        repository and all the his changes will be automatically
        converted into commits. gitfs will also expose the history
        of the branch you're currently working on by simulating
        snapshots of every commit.

      - Claudiu Popa - 12 years of Pylint (or How I learned to stop worrying about bugs)

        Given the dynamic nature of Python, some bugs tend
        to creep in our codebases. Innocents NameErrors or
        hard-to-find bugs with variables used in a closure,
        but defined in a loop, they all stand no chance in
        front of Pylint.

      - Cosmin Poieana - Argus: the omniscient CI

        Bring the continuous integration to a new level,
        through a platform/project independent framework
        able to give you unittest-like reports. Argus is a
        scenario-based application written in Python, driven
        by custom recipes under configurable environments,
        that can be used for testing a wide variety of small
        and big projects, with the ability of querying live
        data from the in-test application.

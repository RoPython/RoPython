One reason for Python's popularity (and a reason for many of its quirks
...) is its strong ties to the C programming language. CPython, the
reference Python interpreter, allows advanced users to interact with the
interpreter's inner workings, and extend the Python language with code
written in C.

This talk gives a very high-level overview of the CPython C API, and
shows how to build a C extension in a few steps. It then discusses a
popular use case for C extensions - optimizing performance of your
Python programs! Finally we're gonna look at some modern alternatives to
getting more performance out of your Python code, e.g. Cython.

About Steffen Wenz:

    Steffen is the CTO of TrustYou (with offices in Cluj and Munich).
    TrustYou crawls and semantically analyzes all hotel reviews, and then
    generates a human-readable summary for each hotel on the planet. Did
    guests like the service? Was the location OK? Chances are you've seen
    our data on one of the many websites we license it to - among them Kayak
    and Google :) TrustYou is a Python company. We use Hadoop streaming and
    Pyspark to bring Python to the big data era. Steffen has been with
    TrustYou since 2008. His master thesis laid the foundation for
    TrustYou's scalable semantic analysis, which today understands 20
    languages natively.

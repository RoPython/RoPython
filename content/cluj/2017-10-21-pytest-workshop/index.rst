Hello everyone,

We're back in action with a Pytest workshop. It's going to take about
2-3 hours and there will be pizza & drinks provided by Yonder.

The only requirement is to bring a laptop with Python installed.

Workshop's content:

* preparation & setting up tox/virtualenv/django/pytest
* writing tests for the Django tutorial polls app (just the test part,
  the app code will be provided)

Aim is to cover these pytest topics:

* test discovery
* classes vs function tests
* assertion helpers
* marks, skipping & xfailing
* parametrization
* fixtures, scoping, finalization
* builtin fixtures overview
* pytest-django plugin

Tutors will be Ionel and highschool-teacher-turned-programmer Gabriel Muj.

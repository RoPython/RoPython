      - Introduction in optical character recognition with python (Toni Simu)

        Many of you probably felt the need for OCR back in college trying to
        turn photos of course pages into editable text, later to become: smart
        cheatsheets. Now you have the chance to see how you can use it in your
        life and understand how it works. Iâ€™ll be walking you through the
        technology used behind it (tesseract and opencv) and point out a few
        buttons you can tweak to improve text recognition accuracy. You should
        also expect multiple demos on the subject followed by a short Q&A
        session.

      - Running Python (Django) production apps on Docker (Felix Kerekes)

        The talk will walk you through our journey as an early stage start-up
        managing our own SaaS infrastructure. It begins with why we ditched
        Fabric and SaltStack for a fully Docker-powered infrastructure. It
        will cover running basic Docker containers to managing and deploying
        multiple full-stack environments using Docker Cloud. We will also
        explore Docker's future, based around the new Docker Swarm, introduced
        in v1.12.

      - AWS: love-hate relationship (`Alexander Shchapov <https://github.com/alexanderad>`_)

        Amazon Web Services is a great infrastructure platform one can chose.
        From startup to enterprise. From one instance to tens of thousands.
        Dozens of services, computing instances, automation, queues,
        databases, storage of literally endless size. But with great tools
        comes a necessity to manage the infrastructure, orchestrate park of
        services and instances, ensure secure and reliable deployments. At
        iMedicare we use AWS for the complete product life-cycle of a
        sophisticated web-application which comes along with data processing
        pipelines. While using this platform we learned many things, some of
        which in a hard way. I'm going to share our experiences, dark and
        bright side of EC2 computing nodes, managed Postgres in RDS and huge
        scale column oriented storage Redshift.

      - Docker powered pytest fixtures for integration tests. (`Radu Ciorba <https://github.com/rciorba/>`_)

        We'll be looking at how pytest fixtures and the docker python api can
        make our lives easier when writing integration tests.
        AKA stories from that time I wrote an ansible plugin to manage etcd
        cluster membership.

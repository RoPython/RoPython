      - Transaction Monitoring and Money Laundering (Cristi Persic, Oana Ratiu, Ariel Pontes)

        Every day, millions of transactions between people or organizations
        take place, amongst which there might, just might, be some that are
        suspicious. Our job is to identify these transactions and why they do
        not fit a normal pattern. Hence, why we built our transaction
        monitoring platform. We will be talking about the reasons why this
        platform needed to be both generic and flexible and how we achieved
        this. We will go on to discuss:

        * Why different clients have different needs depending on the
          information they choose to store on their transactions. Why
          traditional SQL tables are not entirely suited to this application and
          why NoSQL is a natural alternative, as we still need all the
          traditional layers of validation and normalization of external input.
        * The challenge of building an engine that is optimised to process
          large numbers of transactions, whilst at the same time being flexible
          enough to support all the different styles of analysis that are
          required to detect money laundering and terrorist financing.
        * And in terms of performance how far you can take ORM and when it is
          acceptable to take matters into your own hands. Finally, we will
          discuss splitting business logic between python code and database
          queries.

      - Machine Learning Supermarket Paralysis (Cristi Lungu)

        Over the last three years deep learning has exploded in popularity and
        the quality of the results has greatly improved. Big tech companies
        have increased their research budgets in order to benefit from this
        revolution. As a direct consequence several of these (Microsoft,
        Google, Facebook, Amazon) have released open frameworks for training
        and developing deep architectures such as: TensorFlow, CNTK,
        FBLearner, MxNET and Caffe. Beside these, other popular existing
        frameworks and wrappers coming mainly from academia, have gathered a
        great deal of support (Theano, Torch7, Scikit-learn, Keras). With such
        a broad choice, it's no surprise that choosing the "right" Machine
        Learning (ML) framework can lead to a paradox of choice (especially
        for beginner ML students). This talk will give an overview of what ML
        frameworks are and what they do. We will discuss in more detail
        TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Theano and Keras, highlighting the pros and
        cons for each of these frameworks. Finally, we will demonstrate them
        by applying them to a simple linear regression task.

-------

**Persic Alexandru Cristian (Backend Lead)** studied computer science at
"Stefan cel Mare" University, followed by a masters degree in software
engineering (apparently 5 years of study was not good enough). At
university he started working at an outsource company using Microsoft
technologies and enjoyed each step from helping with JavaScript to
implementing custom workflows in SharePoint. After 5 years he saw the
light and moved to Python/Django, building a mobile advertising
platform from the ground up. In 4 years he managed to gain plenty of
experience in managing the implementation, deployment and maintenance
of a large scale web application. In 2016 Cristi made a daring move
and joined ComplyAdvantage in the quest of finding once more the
excitement of building a new and successful product, all the while
fighting crime like any other regular superhero.

**Ariel Pontes (Python Engineer)** studied Computer Engineering at
the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. After learning
Python/Django in his first internship in a fintech startup he fell in
love with MVC frameworks, and re-wrote his final year project in Ruby
on Rails. In 2014 he moved to Cluj and started working as a full-stack
Django developer in a big outsourcing company. Ariel joined
ComplyAdvantage in 2016 where he works on the transaction monitoring
and screening platforms. Outside of work you can find him
participating in activism for local NGOs and preaching about secular
ethics.

**Oana Ratiu (Python Engineer)** graduated from Babes-Bolyai
University, Cluj-Napoca, studying computer science, and is currently
completing her Master's Degree in Databases. She has worked as a
programmer for three years, mostly with Python. Excited to fight
terrorism through her work, Oana joined ComplyAdvantage in early 2016,
working on a transaction monitoring platform and, more recently, on a
screening platform.

**Cristian Lungu (Senior Python/ML Engineer)** wrote (anti)viruses for fun
and profit for 5 years until he realised how much money flows through
the stock market. He then spent his next 5 years coding derivatives,
futures and options. Somehow, he was kidnapped and dropped on this
startup ship called ComplyAdvantage where fighting terrorists and
money laundering with machine learning is the only way to get a meal.
As a result of this event, he challenged himself to actually finish
his lifelong hobby, a PhD in machine learning, this century. When he
doesn't code he's probably teaching bubble sort at the UTCN or
conducting practical studies of gradient descent on some mountains.

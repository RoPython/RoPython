      - Managing technical debt (`Mircea Zetea <https://ep2016.europython.eu/conference/p/mircea-zetea>`_)

        Technical debt lives among us regardless if we are in the services
        business or building products. We discuss about it, we try to fix it
        or live with it, but can we actually prevent it? My reason for
        discussing this openly is because once it is there you do not only
        deal with the technical debt itself but also with the interest you
        must pay. My reason for discussing this openly is because once it is
        there you do not only deal with the technical debt itself but also
        with the interest you must pay. Comparing the two, probably the
        highest cost that we see is with the interest. As our code base grows
        and our deadlines get tougher we tend to forget about the cost our
        project will have to pay for every functionality that we implement in
        a hurry, for which we “forget” about tests or for which we write in a
        comment “this needs to be refactored” or “this is a temporary
        solution. refactor later”. What qualifies as debt? What qualifies as
        interest? How do we manage it? At what levels in our projects can we
        see the debt and the interest? Is it really unavoidable?

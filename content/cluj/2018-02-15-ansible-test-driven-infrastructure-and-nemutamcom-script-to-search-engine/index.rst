      - **Ansible - test driven infrastructure** (`Alexandru Hapliuc <https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandru-hapliuc-2b360729/>`_)

        Everything becomes code defined and test driven. Lately even
        Infrastructure has become an adept of that. The presentation will
        briefly how Ansible, Molecule and Docker help us achieve that.

        The talk goes through the project's 4 year history, starting from a
        70-line bash script to a scalable, distributed system, along with the
        problems and lessons we've learned along the way. Topics include
        Python, Selenium, running on top of Linux, distributed systems and
        performance.

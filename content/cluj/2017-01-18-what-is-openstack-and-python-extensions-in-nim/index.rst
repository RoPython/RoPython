        Ever wonder what `OpenStack <http://www.openstack.org/>`_ is and how Python is used to build the
        largest open source cloud operating system ? Well, this presentation
        is for you! We will focus on the main building blocks of OpenStack,
        how everything is connected and why Python was the main programming
        language chosen.

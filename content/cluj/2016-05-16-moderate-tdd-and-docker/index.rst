Talks
=====

Moderate TDD
------------

This talk is aimed at programmers who already have experience with
unit testing and they either did not try Extreme Programming/TDD or
they simply consider those too extreme :-) The content is about Python
but the techniques could be used in any other language, even touching
HTML/CSS/JS.

There is going to be a discussion about line vs feature coverage,
continuous and pre-merge testing, debugging based on tests and
practices for maintaining test code.

Docker for Python apps
----------------------

This talk is going to give an intro to Docker, how can you build
images quickly, few recommendations about moving Python apps in
containers and many complaints about Docker :-)

Celery is an asynchronous task queue based on distributed message
passing. It is focused on real-time operations, but supports
scheduling as well. RabbitMQ, is a message broker which is used by
Celery to distribute messages.

Celery is perfectly suited for tasks which will take some time to
execute but we donâ€™t want our requests to be blocked while these tasks
are processed.
Example use cases: sending emails, heavy background processing (eg:
multimedia encoding), sending bulk messages, periodic tasks, complex
concurrent workflows.

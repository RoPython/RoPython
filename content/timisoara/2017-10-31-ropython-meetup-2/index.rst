The next meetup will take place on the 31st of October.

Agenda:

*   Gabriel Trautmann presenting techniques for optimizing Python code in
    the context of "Form Recognition Clustering with Locality Sensitive
    Hashing".

*   Mihai Balint - Python' async web framework performance gauntlet - 2017 edition

    In this presentation we compare the performance of modern async web
    frameworks running on python 3.6. The contenders are tested in four
    scenarios designed to emphasize common tasks undertaken by web
    frameworks: serializing objects to json, building html from a
    template, fetching data from a database and querying third-party http
    endpoints. We match the popular against the obscure and the pure
    against the compiled in an effort to discover the king of requests per
    second.

Stay tuned for more details!

Fat models? Service module? Clean architecture?

Let's get together and talk about strategies for organizing business
logic in Django applications. What have we each used, what we liked
about the chosen strategies, what were the downsides, what we'd like
to try next.

I would like this to be a discussion and not a presentation, so please
don't be shy :)

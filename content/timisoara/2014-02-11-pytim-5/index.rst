Happy New Year from behalf of PyTim!


The first #Python meetup of 2014 will take place on February 11. The
format is the same as in the previous meet ups.


Here is the Agenda:


* Radu Ciorba (`3Pillar Global Romania <https://www.facebook.com/ThreePillarGlobal>`__) - "Concurrency in Python Overview: Processes, Threads and Greenlets"
* Adam Collard (`Canonical Ltd <https://www.facebook.com/pages/Canonical-Ltd/112304012115618>`__) - "Python 3.4. What's coming?"
* Alessandro Pilotti (`Cloudbase Solutions <https://www.facebook.com/CloudbaseSolutions>`__) - "Interoperable OpenStack guest initialization with Python"

Each presentation will last around 30 minutes + Q/A. There will be
short, 10 minute coffee breaks in between sessions.

Thanks,

See you on February 11!
